# Ensemble-Learning
Ensemble Learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models to improve performance, accuracy, and robustness. By aggregating predictions from various models, it reduces errors like bias and variance, leading to better generalization compared to a single model. Examples include Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking.
